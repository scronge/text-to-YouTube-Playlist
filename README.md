# text-to-YouTube-Playlist

Python app that uses the YouTube API to turn a list of song names in order to create a YouTube playlist. Runs in Google Colab notebook.

After losing many songs in a failed ITunes backup, I was able to recover the text file.

The only downsides are that the API is rate-limited and you must submit a form to request a cap increase, and it rarely returns the top result for that query which in very few cases is not the original song.
