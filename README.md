# text-to-YouTube-Playlist
Uses the YouTube API to turn a list of song names in order to create a playlist

My dad lost a lot of songs after a failed backup on an old ITunes library so I made him this replacement after finding the text file for the playlist on ITunes Desktop

The only downsides are that the API is rate-limited and you have to submit a form to request a cap increase, and that it returns the top result for that query which in very few cases is not the song (could be a live concert or some random)
